## The Canvas Drawing Assignment

### Introduction

During the Introduction to Web Development (COMP 1536) course at BCIT, I was first introduced to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Time went by, and as we were fast approaching the end of the course, we were introduced to HTML `<canvas>` tag along with the appropriate Javascript scripts. It was good and all, until the *assignment followed along...*


### The Assignment

The goal of the assignment was pretty simple. **Draw a car**. *Oh, okay. Wait, smokes too?* They are *animated?* And why is the car so *smooth and shiny and perfect in the example...* is that even possible? These were some of the initial thoughts I had during the first scan of the assignment. Although the `<canvas>` tag was new to me at that time, I must say I underestimated just how much frustration and agony `<canvas>` had planned for me.

### Result

I'm going to display the result first, so you first get a visual representation of what was done in the assignment.
